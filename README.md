# varieties

The research is based on the paper A Survey on <I>Varieties Generated by Small Semigroups and a Companion Website</I> (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05817.pdf).

To generate the the inputs files for MACE4, run at the project level

src/varieties/formula_gen.py <n> <dir>
  
where n is the level (at least 4) up to which to generate inputs file, and dir (optional, default currently directory) is the directory to deposit the Mace4 inputs files.  The inputs files are named as level<level>_<branch>.in.
